<h1 class="display-4">tP comments dashboard</h1>

Sorted based on the number of review comments given to _others'_ PRs, but also showing comments on own PRs and other comments given. **Updated weekly**. Only those who gave at least one <tooltip content="comments added to a specific place in the PR code">review comment</tooltip> are listed in this dashboard.
