Perhaps it isn't necessary for the actual deadline to be explicitly mentioned when we want to delete a deadline. A change in the `validateArguments` might be needed for this. So ideally, a command to delete a deadline would look like `delete -a "Akutami" -m "Kaisen" -d`.

Edit: This is just me thinking about implementation details, but a suggestion I have about implementing this is in the `DELETE` switch case we update the options for `-d` to not require an argument and add a `isDelete` flag in `validateArguments` to bypass the check for a quoted argument following `-d`. Might not be the cleanest implementation. To be further discussed!

Minor semantic issue. `createFileIfNeeded` returns `false` if created successfully aka no issue. The `if` branch runs when `hasIssuesWithDataFile` is true. What was the intended flow here? If `hasIssues`, we try to write? If we know that there are issues, why are we still trying to write? Correct me if I am missing something. Might be better to update variable naming and method flow to reflect the obvious and 'happy' path.

I would say if we specify this (the usage and what it means) in the User Guide it should be fine, since we're using the short flags of `-a` and `-m` for Author and Manga respectively. But it is possible for me to implement a change to use `--by` instead of `-b` if that is what you mean.

Put showHistory() function contents into toString(). The intention with writing toString() here with the "History" placeholder was to fill in with your history printing. Rationale for this is that toString() is a standardized way to say that the function represents the class as a string, making it easier to integrate.

Comments should describe "why" you're doing something, not how. From reading the code, it's obvious that history.put overwrites the day with same date. What you might want to comment instead is why you design it that way (i.e. we assume users only log one workout for a given day). Doing this in general will make your comments more useful.

I would do /m for index, /n for name and /c for calories. it's okay to reuse the exercise's /n flag as the user will never expect to input exercise details and meal details in the same command. /m for mealIndex also follows the convention that /p is prog index, /d is day index etc.

I understand that each field has to be in a certain order now, and the user should ensure that is satisfied when inputting their commands. However, I feel like the naming of variables can be more clear on what the order is to help future developers.

I don't fully agree with you. `size()` does the same thing as the underlying method of the `ArrayList`. I think what we can do it have `AuthorList` extend `ArrayList&lt;Author>`, like how I did it in my iP: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0656a3d-2fd2-4cf9-befc-a048e569a122)

Then `size()` will just be an overridden method.

I believe so. The default deserializer knows what to do. `Author` requires its own one as each `Manga` within its `MangaList` attribute requires a reference back to the `Author` to satisfy the bidirectional navigability we have between `Author` and `Manga`.

The branch `branch-test-rebase` was created before changes from #16 are merged into the upstream, and by extension my fork's master branch. Test commits will be made on it. Once the changes from #16 are merged, I will try the proposed rebase-based workflow above and see if there are any issues.

Ok from my research from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16330782) and [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing#The-Perils-of-Rebasing), I have concluded that there shouldn't be any issues with this workflow, as long as: 
1. the branch isn't pushed onto your own fork before you rebase, or
2. the branch is pushed onto your own fork, but no one has cloned it to do work on it. 

For `2.`, a `git push --force-with-lease` is required to override the base of the fork on the fork origin.

Just a heads-up on git format guidelines, the base form of the verb should be used in commit messages.

>Possible to read/load from one file but write the save file to another destination to prevent the overwriting? Just an idea.

Do you mean just for tests? Because if we do this for the main app we need to get the user to indicate where they last saved their data. 

>1. Set up dataFile in Storage to be a different path before running any JUnit test for commands that modify the authorList

Actually, option 1 is already implemented, but only in `StorageTest`. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/122bd2f1-5700-4923-81f5-b58405715a26)

So all we need to do it extend it so that all tests do this.

Alright, I did that for `StorageTest`. For future development it is probably worth it to set a global JUnit setting so that all tests use a different data file. However, it needs to be deconflicted with `testCatalog.json` which is needed by `StorageTest`. It shouldn't be changed.

- Need final confirmation on whether the source code run fine without `System.setOut(new PrintStream(System.out, true, StandardCharsets.UTF_8))`. 
- On my end, when I extract the .jar file to a new folder and run it in terminal, the printing seems fine
- When I run it in Intellij, the printing of table is filled with `?` (Is there any config (VM options?) that was previously changed and need to revert back now?)

I agree with Paul. It is also easier for programmers to trace function calls. If it ever gets too messy or has too many commands, we can always refactor commands such as `Add`, `Delete`, `Generate`, etc. to a single command like `ActionCommand` in the future. Let's discuss more on the names and the milestones on Monday.

I can't fix this bug, we probably have to make the user 

1. get out of the app using `exit`
2. run `chcp 65001` to change to UTF-8 encoding
3. run `java -jar FindOurSEP.jar` to get back in

This should probably be done at a later stage when we implement file reading and storage systems, so that the user does not lose their data when relogging into the application.

1. `stats -gpamax &lt;UNI_INDEX>`
2. `stats -gpamin &lt;UNI_INDEX>`

What i mean is that the delete command should work differently, as in stop inheriting from the FindStudentCommand and use the deleteStudent method of the studentList

this might make it harder to troubleshoot if it does get pass the first check in addStudent.

When adding student, if the command somehow didn't know that they are duplicate but this one know, then there's no way for the user to find the duplicate id and delete it since, well this is find command. 

Obviously the user might know that this is the problem from the fact that the command throw, but it still a bad user experience

The current StudentList.deleteStudent create a new student object from name and id and call List&lt;Student>.remove() to remove it, but the .remove() method needed the .equals() to be implemented, or else it will just check for reference (aka memory address) which will always be different despite two student object have the same value.

Of course, if you decided to change the logic to the current one we're using in DeleteStudentCommand, then it would work as normal again, but it would still come in handy to compare student object in a command in case a command ever need to

I think assertions are unnecessary for the list command since it involves straightforward data retrieval and display, not input validation or state changes. There is no risk of invalid or unexpected data at runtime. Even if the patient records list is empty, it is a normal scenario, not an error, and can be handled with a message like "No patients found."

I think we shouldn't be checking for the equivalence of score because even if the scores are different as long as the component and the student is the same, we should throw an exception (duplicate Grade object). 

Unless we want to implement the functionality where it overrides the existing Grade object with one with a new score?

Just to confirm that score is a fraction that represents the percentage score. 

What happens if not all the grades are in yet? Currently it seems the GPA will still be computed assuming that the pending grades are 0. Not sure if this is intended behaviour. 

Otherwise looks good to me.

Sorry I don't understand how equals() is required to delete a Student from the StudentList.

Currently StudentList.deleteStudent(String matricNumber, String name) is implemented without requiring a comparison of Student objects.

A new copy of the list can be useful if we do implement a feature in the future that is able to revert any changes. However, if we would want to consistently run multiple allocation rounds, perhaps modifying the original list might be better for memory purposes

I like the neatness of the sequence diagram, it gives a clear overview of how the command works!

Here are some suggestions:
1. For the self-call, I think would be great to include the dashed line to show the context switch from displaySchoolList back to the execute method, after the list has been printed! 
2. Should the arguments for the method calls have its type too? (such as execute(userInput: String))
3. The "return JsonObject" and "Print list of Uni names" arrows can be changed to a dashed one!

Well done! I like the ref abstractions. 
**I have two remarks:** 
1. To avoid confusion please rename this to saveMeal instead of addMeal since it shows the "save meal" command for saving a meal to the mealOptions. 
2. In an alternative box the other alternative paths should usually also be depicted. I like the way you omitted them but I would double check this with prof to make sure its correct.

- Adding calories and meals is done. 
Note: Instead of using a second calorie class and duplicating code from the meal class, I made the name of a meal `Optional&lt;String>`. The `MealEntry` class inherits from the `Meal` class. This way we do not need two distinct objects for tracking meal entries with and without a name. 
- To track calorie history meals are added into a `mealEntries` instance of `MealEntriesList`. To implement the deletion you can simply add the command to the `MealEntriesList` class or preferably in its superclass `MealList`. Then implement the logic when the deletion is conducted in the `ChatParser` class.

Try to implement this as soon as possible as saving files is one of our core features.
Perhaps this could work for the error handler:
logger.log(Level.SEVERE, "Failed to save data to file: ``{``0``}``", e.getMessage());
throw new RuntimeException("Failed to save hospital data", e);

I don't think this test unit of `addRecipeCommand` will need to manually adding a filled `RecipeList`. Just an empty `RecipeList` will do the job since the `add` command doesn't required a `recipeList` to be non-empty.

An alternative way is to use the `@Before` (`@BeforeEach`, `@BeforeAll`) tag provided by JUnit to prepare a pre-filled `RecipeList`. Maybe [this](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-annotations) will help.

Following this method, I believe everything will be more organized as we will have a main Parser to call each separate class' parser

Would it be better if we interchanged the names of the 'index' and 'id' variables here ? because the user will be referring to the id of the internship in their argument right ? And while deleting the internship, we'll refer to the actual index of the internship in the array which is (id - 1). Let me know if my understanding is correct because I just went through all the code you committed bro haha

Looks good overall but wouldn't it be better if instead of setStatus(status) on line 50, we call the new updateStatus(status) function which you have implemented ? In this way, we can check for the invalid input cases also when setting the status. I will merge the changes now but I shall change this line in my next pull request if you give me the permission to do so, thanks !

Sorry, my auto formatter seems to have done some unnecessary changes to the format of the code in the Internship class file. Do change it back to how it was previously if you want or let me know if you want me to change it, thanks ! I couldn't find any functional issues with the code though, seems to work fine for most ideal cases.

Please do take a look at the commit message in the commit hash a4acd2f where I have went over all the changes made in this pr. Have not focused too much on the coding style in this pr and have not addressed the suggestions given in the previous pr yet. Will make the necessary refactoring changes and add the JavaDoc comments in the next pr. Do take note of the Example Test Run file under the test folder to get an idea of the expected input and output. Thanks !

could we store phoneNumber as a string?

because the user inputs phone number as a string,

if we store phoneNumber initially as int, we will need to convert user input from string to int.

but would it be better to just store phoneNumber as string, so we just compare strings. ?

Maybe its better to have a guard clause to prevent arrowhead. 
If it exists call `getPasswordHashFromStorage` and return. Then, use try-catch afterwards and initialise passwordHash with `Login().createNewUser`. directly.

im not sure whether we should bring in a new package when floats or doubles would probably suffice for two decimal points which we will likely not do any arithmetic calculations to alter the values, likely only comparison is necessary which to and there are ways to compare accurately as well like

```

public class FloatComparison ``{``
    public static boolean areEqual(float num1, float num2, float epsilon) ``{``
        return Math.abs(num1 - num2) < epsilon;
    ``}``

    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        float num1 = 1.2345f;
        float num2 = 1.2346f;

        // Use a small epsilon, e.g., 0.01f for two decimal places
        float epsilon = 0.01f;

        if (areEqual(num1, num2, epsilon)) ``{``
            System.out.println("The numbers are equal up to two decimal places.");
        ``}`` else ``{``
            System.out.println("The numbers are not equal.");
        ``}``
    ``}``
``}``

My opinion is that the these two features which we are trying to achieve is different from the focus on the report as of now. The report that we are generating now is more of student focused, whereas these things tend to be more university focused. I think it would make more sense if these were commands.

By the way, my remark on the edit command:

If the user writes something like 
`edit 1 /price 2.50`

then description and category would be null. The expense's description and category fields may also be overwritten to null (?)

General concept (from the discussions)
1. We implement JUnit tests using existing error handling practices
2. We make new PRs implementing error handling using WheresMyMoneyException and modify JUnit tests to support those

Nice sequence diagram! I would like to corroborate point 2 made by @chewycj. I observed prof declaring the type of the arguments in his lecture. A specific example is shown below:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21462b25-6c26-46fc-a300-ffc2390ded96)

I would also like to make the observation that i think the return value of the self-invocation, `disaplaySchoolList()`, should be that of a `:type` or a `name:type`. I am not sure that a statement "List of school names" belongs in a sequence diagram. 

Otherwise, fire diagram!

I've created Commands to see historicCalories and todayCalories. 
You can specify the number of days back you would like to see in historicCalories. It will print out the progress Bars for each day with the date beside them. 

I also edited the Bar printing function to ensure the bars stay the same length when there are different percentages inside the square brackets. eg. (1% vs 25% vs 180%)

I saw that they were checking for asserts & loggers in the tp dashboard. Let me know if I went overkill with them.

This issue has been completed. I have added unit tests for the QuizManager, including assert statements to validate input, and implemented logging to track key operations such as starting quizzes and saving results. All tests have been run successfully. Please review and merge the changes.

Fixed checkstyle issues. Path problems can be caused by a mismatch in computer systems.

I think float is enough for storing GPA. I will sort GPAs in a descending order, so as long as the data type is comparable, the algorithm will work.

> My opinion is that the these two features which we are trying to achieve is different from the focus on the report as of now. The report that we are generating now is more of student focused, whereas these things tend to be more university focused. I think it would make more sense if these were commands.

What do you think we should name these two new commands?

I left existing wildcard (*) imports and the UITest class untouched as to not mess with your your approaches. 
Those seem to be the one's tripping the automated style testing. :)
